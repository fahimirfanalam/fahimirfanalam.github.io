In this regard, breast ultrasonography images are frequently utilized by doctors to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. However, the complex artifacts and heavily noised breast ultrasonography images make diagnosis a great challenge. Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of patients being screened for breast cancer necessitates the use of automated end-to-end technology for highly accurate diagnosis at a low cost and in a short time. In this concern, to develop an end-to-end integrated pipeline for breast ultrasonography image classification, we conducted an exhaustive analysis of image preprocessing methods such as K Means++ and SLIC, as well as four transfer learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and ResNet50. With a Dice-coefficient score of 63.4 in the segmentation stage and accuracy and an F1-Score (Benign) of 73.72 percent and 78.92 percent in the classification stage, the combination of SLIC, UNET, and VGG16 outperformed all other integrated combinations. Finally, we have proposed an end to end integrated automated pipelining framework which includes preprocessing with SLIC to capture super-pixel features from the complex artifact of ultrasonography images, complementing semantic segmentation with modified U-Net, leading to breast tumor classification using a transfer learning approach with a pre-trained VGG16 and a densely connected neural network. The proposed automated pipeline can be effectively implemented to assist medical practitioners in making more accurate and timely diagnoses of breast cancer.","tags":["Elsevier","Journal"],"title":"Deep integrated pipeline of segmentation guided classification of breast cancer from ultrasound images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643328e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643328e3,"objectID":"a7ccedf5195af21349dba103f6ba80fc","permalink":"https://rizwan-hasan.github.io/recommendations/fahim-irfan-alam/","publishdate":"2022-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/recommendations/fahim-irfan-alam/","section":"recommendations","summary":"**Associate Professor at [University of Chittagong](https://cu.ac.bd/)** **‟** I have known Rizwan since 2020 in the capacity of one of the course instructors and fellow researcher.

The survival rates have, however, improved dramatically in recent years, thanks to the advances in the screening and treatment process, hugely depending on how early the disease was detected. Along with the physicians, this had also initiated researchers all over the globe to dedicate themselves to extensive research to produce automated diagnosis strategies for breast cancer. Realizing the extraordinary potential of machine learning-based models in the biomedical domain, a large number of diagnosis methods have been proposed in this direction. In our study, we propose a hybrid unique machine learning framework that integrates individual prediction probabilities from 3 machine learning (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K Nearest Neighbors) classifiers, then enhances the performance of these 3 classifiers through hybridization, stacking a gradient boosting algorithm over the combination of these classifiers which ultimately results in a 10 Fold Cross Validation Score of 98.4%, Recall of 100% and Precision of 97.3%. Besides, to handle the class imbalance problem we have incorporated SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for minority classes and also Robust Scaling for normalization to deal with outliers in the dataset. In our proposed hybrid solution, we successfully adopted the breast cancer domain in every stage of our framework, starting from data pre-processing, feature extraction and finally classification. Our framework outperformed some recent state of the art studies in the breast cancer domain.","tags":["IEEE"],"title":"A Hybrid Probabilistic Ensemble based Extreme Gradient Boosting Approach For Breast Cancer Diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Sakib Khan Inan","Rubaiath E Ulfath","Fahim Irfan Alam","Fateha Khanam Bappee","Rizwan Hasan"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This hormonal disorder may further lead to the risk of other long-term complications. Considering the powerful recognition abilities of the probabilistic nature of ensemble-based gradient boosting algorithms, particularly in the field of the medical domain, we propose the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, for early detection of PCOS. To strongly support an effective classification performance, we have resampled our data using a combination of SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques) \u0026 ENN (Edited Nearest Neighbour), to solve class imbalance and data outliers issues. Also, by exploiting popular statistical correlation methods, ANOVA Test Chi-Square Test, we have identified 23 most significant metabolic and clinical parameters that best classify PCOS conditions. Finally, we experimented with our model on a benchmark dataset collected from Kaggle to justify the effectiveness of our proposed findings where the Extreme Gradient Boosting classifier outperformed all other classifiers with a 10 Fold Cross-validation score of 96.03 % all over, along with a 98% Recall in the detection of patients not having PCOS, which outperforms all the existing recent methods where the numerical data-driven diagnosis of PCOS have been studied on this particular dataset.","tags":["IEEE"],"title":"Improved Sampling and Feature Selection to Support Extreme Gradient Boosting For PCOS Diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fahim Irfan Alam","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In this regard, unmixing approaches are being successfully carried out to decompose mixed pixels into a collection of spectral signatures. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate unmixing into a deep feature learning model in order to classify hyperspectral data. We propose to generate superpixels from the abundance estimations of the underlying materials of the image obtained from an unsupervised endmember extraction algorithm called vertex component analysis (VCA). The mean abundances of the superpixels are then used as features for a deep classifier. Our proposed deep model, formulated as a joint convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, receives significant spectral-spatial information in the data to produce better and powerful features and achieve improved classification performance than several alternative methods.","tags":["IEEE"],"title":"Abundance-Guided Superpixels and Recurrent Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Recent research has shown that training multilayer neural networks can extensively improve the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.

This method directly learns a mapping from images to a Euclidean space in which distances directly correspond to a measure of spectral-spatial similarity. Once this embedding has been established, classification can be implemented with such embeddings as feature vectors. Moreover, we also augment the size of the training samples in different band groups. This produces different yet useful estimation of spectral-spatial characteristics of HSI data and contributes considerably in accurate classification.

Considering the usefulness of these techniques, we propose to utilize the unmixing results as an input to classifiers for better classification accuracy. We propose a novel band group based structure preserving nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method to estimate the individual spectral responses from different materials within different ranges of wavelengths.

This demands to optimize the computations as much as possible in order to reduce both computational and communication complexity. This paper proposes a framework which can be used to perform segmentation for a particular object by incorporating optimization in subsequent steps.

This proposed framework will handle all kinds of transactions by electronic means e.g. Push Pull services offering Short Message Service(SMS), road-side booths containing a web interface.

In order to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, a more complete model of the OOI is needed. To this end, we revise the concept of directional spatial templates and introduce regional directional spatial templates as a means of including spatial relationships among OOI regions into the model. We present an object segmentation algorithm that learns a model which includes both visual and spatial information. Given a training set of images containing the OOI, each image is oversegmented into visually homogeneous regions. Next, Multiple Instance Learning identifies regions that are likely to be part of the OOI. For each pair of such regions and for each relationship, a regional template is formed. The computational cost of template generation is reduced by sampling the reference region with a pixel set that is descriptive of its shape.

Due to the OOI consisting of visually different fragments, traditional segmentation algorithms that are based on the identification of homogeneous regions usually do not perform well. In order to narrow this gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, some recent methods employ machine learning to generate more accurate models of the OOI. The main contribution of this paper is the inclusion of spatial relationships among the OOI fragments into the model. For this purpose, we employ Bayesian networks as a probabilistic approach for learning the spatial relationships which, in turn, becomes evidence that is used for the process of segmenting future instances of the OOI. The algorithm presented in this paper also uses multiple instance learning to obtain prototypical descriptions of each fragment of the OOI based on low-level visual features. The experimental results on both artificial and real image datasets indicate that the addition of spatial relationships improves segmentation performance.","tags":["Springer","Journal"],"title":"Learning spatial relations for object-specific segmentation using Bayesian network model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fahim Irfan Alam","Iker Gondra"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Our recently proposed object-specific segmentation algorithm learns a model of the OOI which includes information on both the visual appearance of and the spatial relationships among the OOI components. However, its performance heavily depends on the assumption that the visual appearance variability among OOI instances is low. We present an extension to our algorithm that relaxes this assumption by incorporating shape information into the OOI model. Experimental results and an ANOVA-based statistical test confirm that the incorporation of shape has a highly significant positive effect on segmentation performance.","tags":["ACM","Journal"],"title":"Incorporating shape into spatially-aware adaptive object segmentation algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fahim Irfan Alam","Iker Gondra"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The Bayesian network, as a probabilistic graphical model, in turn becomes evidence that is used for the process of semantically accurate segmentation of future instances of the OOI.
