In this regard, breast ultrasonography images are frequently utilized by doctors to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. However, the complex artifacts and heavily noised breast ultrasonography images make diagnosis a great challenge. Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of patients being screened for breast cancer necessitates the use of automated end-to-end technology for highly accurate diagnosis at a low cost and in a short time. In this concern, to develop an end-to-end integrated pipeline for breast ultrasonography image classification, we conducted an exhaustive analysis of image preprocessing methods such as K Means++ and SLIC, as well as four transfer learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and ResNet50. With a Dice-coefficient score of 63.4 in the segmentation stage and accuracy and an F1-Score (Benign) of 73.72 percent and 78.92 percent in the classification stage, the combination of SLIC, UNET, and VGG16 outperformed all other integrated combinations. Finally, we have proposed an end to end integrated automated pipelining framework which includes preprocessing with SLIC to capture super-pixel features from the complex artifact of ultrasonography images, complementing semantic segmentation with modified U-Net, leading to breast tumor classification using a transfer learning approach with a pre-trained VGG16 and a densely connected neural network. The proposed automated pipeline can be effectively implemented to assist medical practitioners in making more accurate and timely diagnoses of breast cancer.","tags":["Breast Cancer","Ultrasonography Image","Superpixels","U-Net","Transfer Learning","VGG 16","Image Segmentation","Image Classification","Medical Imaging"],"title":"Deep integrated pipeline of segmentation guided classification of breast cancer from ultrasound images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643328e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643328e3,"objectID":"a7ccedf5195af21349dba103f6ba80fc","permalink":"https://fahimirfanalam.github.io/recommendations/fahim-irfan-alam/","publishdate":"2022-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/recommendations/fahim-irfan-alam/","section":"recommendations","summary":"**Associate Professor at [University of Chittagong](https://cu.ac.bd/)** **‟** I have known Rizwan since 2020 in the capacity of one of the course instructors and fellow researcher.

The survival rates have, however, improved dramatically in recent years, thanks to the advances in the screening and treatment process, hugely depending on how early the disease was detected. Along with the physicians, this had also initiated researchers all over the globe to dedicate themselves to extensive research to produce automated diagnosis strategies for breast cancer. Realizing the extraordinary potential of machine learning-based models in the biomedical domain, a large number of diagnosis methods have been proposed in this direction. In our study, we propose a hybrid unique machine learning framework that integrates individual prediction probabilities from 3 machine learning (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K Nearest Neighbors) classifiers, then enhances the performance of these 3 classifiers through hybridization, stacking a gradient boosting algorithm over the combination of these classifiers which ultimately results in a 10 Fold Cross Validation Score of 98.4%, Recall of 100% and Precision of 97.3%. Besides, to handle the class imbalance problem we have incorporated SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for minority classes and also Robust Scaling for normalization to deal with outliers in the dataset. In our proposed hybrid solution, we successfully adopted the breast cancer domain in every stage of our framework, starting from data pre-processing, feature extraction and finally classification. Our framework outperformed some recent state of the art studies in the breast cancer domain.","tags":["Breast Cancer","Wisconsin","SMOTE","Robust Scaling"],"title":"A Hybrid Probabilistic Ensemble based Extreme Gradient Boosting Approach For Breast Cancer Diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Background Under the Chittagong University Research and Higher Studies (CURHS) Autumn Research Internship Program 2020, I supervised a project titled \u0026ldquo;Exploring Segmentation and Classification to Facilitate Effective Detection of Breast Cancer from Ultrasound Images\u0026rdquo;.

Recently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) has established itself as a powerful model in classification by demonstrating excellent performances. The use of a graphical model such as a conditional random field (CRF) contributes further in capturing contextual information and thus improving the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a method to classify hyperspectral images by considering both spectral and spatial information via a combined framework consisting of CNN and CRF. We use multiple spectral band groups to learn deep features using CNN, and then formulate deep CRF with CNN-based unary and pairwise potential functions to effectively extract the semantic correlations between patches consisting of 3-D data cubes. Furthermore, we introduce a deep deconvolution network that improves the final classification performance. We also introduced a new data set and experimented our proposed method on it along with several widely adopted benchmark data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. By comparing our results with those from several state-of-the-art models, we show the promising potential of our method.","tags":["CNN","CRF","Image Classification","Hyperspectral Image","3D Image Data"],"title":"Conditional Random Field and Deep Feature Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fahim Irfan Alam","Jun Zhou","Lei Tong","Alan Wee-Chung Liew","Yongsheng Gao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

A mean-field approximation algorithm for CRF inference is used and formulated with Gaussian pairwise potentials as Recurrent Neural Network. This combined network is then plugged into the CNN which leads to a deep network that has robust characteristics of both CNN and CRF.

This demands to optimize the computations as much as possible in order to reduce both computational and communication complexity. This paper proposes a framework which can be used to perform segmentation for a particular object by incorporating optimization in subsequent steps. The algorithm proposes an optimized K-means algorithm for image segmentation followed by balance calculations in multiple instance learning and topological relations with relative positions to identify OOI regions.

Following a number of years of huge development in this sector, each and every parts of Bangladesh is now under cellular coverage and the teledensity is expected to reach at maximum satisfactory level soon. This success motivates us towards a more reliable \u0026 transparent economic infrastructure through the use of cellular services and intelligent software systems. This paper proposes multilayer network-supported framework which completely eliminates the need and use of paper notes for all kinds of economic transactions. However, the proposed framework is not a threat at all to the present financial institutions and their fundamental mechanisms. Rather, it would be more transparent and free of corruptions as reliable and efficient monitoring of transactions will be possible by respective authorities. This proposed framework will handle all kinds of transactions by electronic means e.g. Push Pull services offering Short Message Service(SMS), road-side booths containing a web interface. Under this distributed system, each and every entity of the entire economic infrastructure will makes it flexible, robust, secure and lawful.

In order to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, a more complete model of the OOI is needed. To this end, we revise the concept of directional spatial templates and introduce regional directional spatial templates as a means of including spatial relationships among OOI regions into the model. We present an object segmentation algorithm that learns a model which includes both visual and spatial information. Given a training set of images containing the OOI, each image is oversegmented into visually homogeneous regions. Next, Multiple Instance Learning identifies regions that are likely to be part of the OOI. For each pair of such regions and for each relationship, a regional template is formed. The computational cost of template generation is reduced by sampling the reference region with a pixel set that is descriptive of its shape. Experiments indicate that regional templates are an effective way of including spatial information into the model which in turn results in a very significant improvement in segmentation performance.","tags":["Regional","Spatial","Visual","OOI","Image Segmentation"],"title":"Learning-Based Object Segmentation Using Regional Spatial Templates and Visual Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iker Gondra","Fahim Irfan Alam"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
