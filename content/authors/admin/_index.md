Fahim Irfan Alam is a Bangladeshi-Australian Research Scientist and Associate Professor of Computer Science. He completed his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Engineering from the [University of Chittagong](https://cu.ac.bd/), Bangladesh in 2008. Later, he completed his Masters in Computer Science from [St. Francis Xavier University](https://www.stfx.ca/), Canada in 2012. During his Masters, he actively worked towards the successful development of significant research projects related to [Image Processing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/image-processing), [Image Segmentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/image-segmentation), [Object Recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/object-recognition), and [Bayesian Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/bayesian-network). Also,
his Master's research was funded by the [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp).  After that, he continued his research works in [Computer Vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-vision) and regularly published well-recognized research works in reputed peer-reviewed international conferences and journals. In 2013, he proposed an [optimized image segmentation algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6572644) which was presented in [International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)](http://cennser.org/ICIEV/) and won Best Paper Award.
In 2019, he received his Ph.D. from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/), Australia. His doctoral research was funded by [Griffith University International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (IPRS)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research-study/scholarships/guiprs). His doctoral research majorly comprised of the exploration of [Hyperspectral Imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/hyperspectral-imaging), a crucial area of [Remote Sensing](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used), with the touch of state-of-the-art [Computer Vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-vision) and [Deep Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/deep-learning-method) algorithms.  After that, he continued working on the development of state-of-the-art [Computer Vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-vision) and Deep Learning-based frameworks for multi-disciplinary fields. In 2021, he actively led a project on Bio-[medical Imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/medical-imaging)-based [Cancer diagnosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cancer-research) with the touch of optimized [Computer Vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-vision) and Deep Learning algorithms. The project ended up showing lightning success with a high-quality publication in a reputed peer-reviewed [journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control) of Computational Biology and Bio-informatics.

He began his teaching career as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Chittagong](https://cu.ac.bd/) in 2008, immediately after completing his Bachelor's. He was subsequently promoted as an Assistant Professor in 2011 and as an Associate Professor in 2020 by fulfilling required academic qualifications and research publications. Over the years, he had taught core computers science courses like [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/artificial-intelligence), [Machine Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/machine-learning), [Computer Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-networks), and [Computer Vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-vision), to the students of undergraduate and Masters levels. He has also supervised several undergraduate and Masters students as thesis supervisor and research supervisor in multiple noteworthy projects. Due to his student-oriented behavior and broad outlook, he has always been popular among students as a course instructor and research supervisor. He strongly believes that every student has great hidden potential inside them, they just need a little inspiration from a responsible mentor to bring the best version of them.

He also worked as a web developer at [Dealer Solutions](https://www.dealersolutions.com.au/), a web development company that provides automotive software and solutions for the Australian retail motor industry in Brisbane, Australia. During his undergraduate and post-graduate programs, he was essentially trained with comprehensive knowledge in the related fields of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Specifically, he had developed substantial research experiences which contributed significantly to several problem-solving tasks associated with different research problems in the field of [Computer Vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-vision) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/artificial-intelligence).
