I've had a serious interest in Computer Vision and Machine Learning research since 2009, and I've been actively working in these fields since then. I am a proud PhD graduate of Griffith University in Australia, where I achieved several noteworthy results in hyperspectral image processing, notably in the field of remote sensing. To continue my PhD research, I'm now looking for innovative ideas for solving more significant concerns in the Hyperspectral Image community. Other related topics in Computer Vision, such as medical image processing, have recently piqued my attention to contribute to the biomedical community.
